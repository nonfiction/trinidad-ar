Now we are ready for the next step in our future growth.</p>\n<div id=\"next-steps\">{{{page.next_steps.content}}}</div>"},{"id":"letter-to-shareholders","slug":"3_letter_to_shareholders","title":"3 Letter To Shareholders","content":"<aside id=\"our-strategy\">{{{page.our_strategy.content}}}</aside>\n\n<h2 id=\"letter-to-shareholders\">Letter To Shareholders</h2>\n<h3 id=\"following-our-plan\">Following our plan</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This past year has been pivotal year in Trinidad’s strategic development; we achieved several important milestones in our long-term plan and our operations continued to perform strongly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 2013, our operations generated adjusted EBITDA that was in line with 2012, recording higher dayrates and margins despite weaker industry activity levels. In addition, our net earnings increased to $71 million or $0.58 per share in 2013, up 29% or $0.12 per share compared to 2012. </p>\n<p>Trinidad was successful in winning the award for one of the few liquefied natural gas related new builds given in 2013. We are currently building a rig destined for the Liard basin in northern Canada where it will be drilling wells to supply a proposed LNG plant on the coast of western Canada. Our new rig is expected to be delivered into operations later in 2014 and once completed will be one of the largest and most technically advanced drilling rigs in Canada.</p>\n<p>One of our most important achievements in 2013 was the joint venture we signed with Halliburton. This agreement has the potential to change the face of Trinidad going forward. Through our joint venture, Trinidad has the first right to supply Halliburton with drilling rigs for any of its integrated projects outside of Canada or the US. To date, we have agreed to operate eight rigs through the joint venture; four in Saudi Arabia and four in Mexico. Currently Halliburton operates more than 100 rigs worldwide, providing the joint venture, and Trinidad, with a huge opportunity for expansion over the coming years. </p>\n<p>During 2013, we continued to dispose of non-core assets and sold our coring assets. The work for these rigs was very seasonal in nature and generated limited operating margin over the full year. By selling this equipment we were able to narrow the focus of our operations and concentrate on what we do well and what generates the best margins, high-performance drilling. </p>\n<p>With all these opportunities around us, we have not lost sight of our goals. For the past few years, we have been very selective in the growth opportunities we have pursued and have remained committed to reducing our leverage. Our debt reduction program is largely completed now, leaving us well positioned for the next stage of our expansion. We continue to be focused on keeping a conservative balance sheet and at December 31, our credit facility was completely paid off and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.8 times. </p>\n<p>The safety of our people remained a top priority in 2013 and we were able to maintain our better-than-industry average safety record. For us, safety is not something we can ever sit back and stop looking for improvements. It is something we keep working at every day, being mindful not to get complacent. We watch for trends and near misses to help us identify higher risk areas and we share successes across the company, so we can all benefit from good ideas and new processes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"our-next-steps\">Our Next Steps</h4>\n<p>Oil and gas companies have recognized the benefits of Trinidad’s high performance equipment and are increasingly demanding this style of equipment. As the industry adapts to meet these demands, we need to stay competitive and continuously upgrade our rigs. In 2014, we will be focusing on upgrading rigs in the four to eight year old range. While these rigs perform well and are relatively modern, their efficiency and marketability can be improved by upgrading specific aspects on these rigs, often with customer support.</p>\n<p>We will also be working on our international joint venture in 2014 and beyond. Partnering with an experienced, global oilfield services provider gives us a new avenue for growth and allows us to expand internationally more quickly than we could have alone. This arrangement also lowers the risk for us, allowing us to reduce our capital exposure and take advantage of our partner’s existing infrastructure and extensive experience.</p>\n<p>Not only do we have exciting international opportunities, we also have growth potential in our own back yard. As Canadian LNG development becomes more certain and the projects pass their regulatory hurdles, we expect that LNG-related activity will continue to ramp up. Trinidad has the right experience and style of equipment for this drilling and currently works for most of the key players in LNG development, positioning us well to benefit from this increased demand. </p>\n<p>As we move in to 2014, we have a large number of opportunities to choose from and the financial flexibility to fund our growth. Our existing business generates strong free cash flow and our conservative balance sheet provides us with a solid base to grow from. We expect industry conditions in 2014 to be similar or slightly better than 2013, with potential growth in Canada driven largely by LNG development and in the US by an ongoing move to high performance equipment. Activity levels and dayrates in the US have begun to improve in the first few months of 2014. If these conditions continue to improve, it would have positive implications for our 2014 results. In addition to these industry improvements, we are ready for the next step in our development – global growth. We expect to see a growing contribution from our international joint venture as we add more rigs and expand our operations outside of North America.</p>\n<div class=\"signature\">Lyle Whitmarsh <span class=\"position\">Chief Executive Officer</span></div>\n<div class=\"signature\">Brent Conway <span class=\"position\">President</span></div>\n<div class=\"date\">March 5, 2014</div>"},{"id":"operations","slug":"4_operations","title":"4 Operations","content":"<div class=\"ops-intro\" id=\"operations_intro\">\n    {{{page.operations_intro.content}}}\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"ops-area-row\" id=\"operations_areas\">\n    <div id=\"operations_canada\" class=\"ops-col ops-col-canada\">\n        {{{page.operations_canada.content}}}\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"operations_us\" class=\"ops-col ops-col-us\">\n        {{{page.operations_us.content}}}\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"operations_international\" class=\"ops-col ops-col-international\">\n        {{{page.operations_international.content}}}\n    </div>\n</div>"},{"id":"next_steps","hidden":true,"slug":"next_steps","title":"Next Steps","content":"<h2 id=\"next-steps-\">Next Steps:</h2>\n<h3 id=\"future-growth-at-home-and-abroad\">Future Growth - at Home and Abroad</h3>\n<p>Trinidad has grown from a small Canadian drilling contractor back in 1996 to become one of the leading high-performance drillers in North America today. We are still growing our business at home; but we are also taking our expertise and modern equipment to the global market.</p>\n<h4 id=\"canadian-lng\">Canadian LNG</h4>\n<p>In Canada, liquefied natural gas (LNG) development is sparking growing interest in western Canada&#39;s natural gas reserves. Asian national oil companies and large oil and gas developers are finding ways to extract, liquefy and export Canada&#39;s natural gas to the Asian market where prices are significantly higher. As regulatory hurdles are passed, demand for rigs that can drill these deep, technically challenging reserves will grow. With a reputation as a high performance driller and a customer base that already includes these companies, Trinidad is a key player in this growing market. </p>\n<h4 id=\"united-states\">United States</h4>\n<p>In the US, we have seen an ongoing switch away from mechanical style drilling equipment towards electrical, automated drilling rigs. These changes play right in to Trinidad&#39;s strategy. We have made our reputation with this style of modern equipment and as its benefits become more widely recognized we see opportunities to grow our fleet and expand our customer base in the US.</p>\n<h4 id=\"international-joint-venture\">International Joint Venture</h4>\n<p>Perhaps our most exciting growth opportunity is our international expansion. Our joint venture with Halliburton Company (Halliburton) gives us an opportunity to add rigs to a broad range of countries in a timeframe we could never have managed alone. Halliburton currently operates more than 100 rigs in more than 20 countries and expects to run a significant number of these rigs through our joint venture in the coming years. So far we have added eight rigs to the joint venture in two countries - Mexico and Saudi Arabia; but this is just the first step in our future global growth.</p>\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n<p>Our reputation for high performance and our international joint venture open doors for us to grow and expand into more countries.</p>\n<p>Trinidad&#39;s joint venture gives it the first right to add rigs to Halliburton&#39;s international integrated projects. Alignment with an experienced global service provider expands our opportunities and lowers our risk.</p>\n<p>Trinidad has strong relationships with the key LNG players; we are already drilling wells and building rigs for them. As this market develops further, Trinidad is perfectly positioned to grow with it.</p>\n<p>Lower leverage and a flexible balance sheet supports us as we grow. Our credit facilities are paid off and our long-term debt does not mature until 2019. </p>\n<p>We assembled a fleet of rigs that meet our customers&#39; needs and continue to build new rigs with industry-leading technology.
