## Step 3:

### Executing our Strategy

We have followed a carefully laid out plan, staying focused on meeting our goals and positioning Trinidad for success. We saw the trends in the industry and built the style of rigs that would be in demand. We paid down debt and have a solid financial base to grow from. We built strong relationships with our customers, locking in their commitment with contracts when we built rigs. All the while, we have stayed focused on our operations and built a culture based on high-performing assets and people. Now we are ready for the next step in our future growth.
