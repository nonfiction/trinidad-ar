In 2013, our operations generated adjusted EBITDA that was in line with 2012, recording higher dayrates and margins despite weaker industry activity levels. In addition, our net earnings increased to $71 million or $0.58 per share in 2013, up 29% or $0.12 per share compared to 2012. 

Trinidad was successful in winning the award for one of the few liquefied natural gas related new builds given in 2013. We are currently building a rig destined for the Liard basin in northern Canada where it will be drilling wells to supply a proposed LNG plant on the coast of western Canada. Our new rig is expected to be delivered into operations later in 2014 and once completed will be one of the largest and most technically advanced drilling rigs in Canada.

One of our most important achievements in 2013 was the joint venture we signed with Halliburton. This agreement has the potential to change the face of Trinidad going forward. Through our joint venture, Trinidad has the first right to supply Halliburton with drilling rigs for any of its integrated projects outside of Canada or the US. To date, we have agreed to operate eight rigs through the joint venture; four in Saudi Arabia and four in Mexico. Currently Halliburton operates more than 100 rigs worldwide, providing the joint venture, and Trinidad, with a huge opportunity for expansion over the coming years. 

During 2013, we continued to dispose of non-core assets and sold our coring assets. The work for these rigs was very seasonal in nature and generated limited operating margin over the full year. By selling this equipment we were able to narrow the focus of our operations and concentrate on what we do well and what generates the best margins, high-performance drilling.
