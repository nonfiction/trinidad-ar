### Step 1:

#### High Performing Rigs

<div class="note">131 land rigs <sup>(1)</sup></div>
<div class="note">80% top tier fleet</div>

As the industry moves to deeper, more challenging drilling, Trinidad stands out as a leader in the drilling sector. Our fleet of modern, technically-advanced rigs drill faster, safer and deeper; saving our customers' money and producing stable revenue for Trinidad. Approximately 80 per cent of our fleet is considered top tier equipment, one of the highest levels in the industry. Being a high performance driller means our rigs are in demand and opens doors to new opportunities.

<div class="footnote"><sup>(1)</sup> Includes 100 per cent of rigs in joint venture, as well as rigs under construction at March 5, 2014</div>
