## The Steps

### Step 1:

#### High Performing Rigs

<div class="note">131 land rigs <sup>(1)</sup></div>
<div class="note">80% top tier fleet</div>

As the industry moves to deeper, more challenging drilling, Trinidad stands out as a leader in the drilling sector. Our fleet of modern, technically-advanced rigs drill faster, safer and deeper; saving our customers' money and producing stable revenue for Trinidad. Approximately 80 per cent of our fleet is considered top tier equipment, one of the highest levels in the industry. Being a high performance driller means our rigs are in demand and opens doors to new opportunities.

<div class="footnote"><sup>(1)</sup> Includes 100 per cent of rigs in joint venture, as well as rigs under construction at March 5, 2014</div>

    <div class="note">6.7 million <small>man-hours worked</small></div>
</div>

Having a management team that comes from the field means we understand what matters in the field and keep connected with our people. Our culture rewards success and encourages crew members to move up the ranks within the company. We have an extensive training program that focuses on growing skill sets and safety, giving our crew members a clear career path at Trinidad. This culture helps retain the best and most skilled people and encourages high performance throughout the company.

### Step 3:

#### Executing our Strategy

</div>

We have followed a carefully laid out plan, staying focused on meeting our goals and positioning Trinidad for success. We saw the trends in the industry and built the style of rigs that would be in demand. We paid down debt and have a solid financial base to grow from. We built strong relationships with our customers, locking in their commitment with contracts when we built rigs. All the while, we have stayed focused on our operations and built a culture based on high-performing assets and people. Now we are ready for the next step in our future growth.
