### Canada

- 62 rigs (1)

- 75% high-performance rigs

In Canada, our rigs are in high demand to work in the most active plays like the Montney, Duvernay and the deep basin. We typically exceed industry activity levels and 2013 was no different with a utilization of 48% compared to the industry average of 40%. In 2013, we finished construction on two new rigs under long-term contracts that both went to work in the Duvernay shale. We also began construction on a new LNG rig that will be delivered in to the Liard Basin in northern Canada in mid-2014.
