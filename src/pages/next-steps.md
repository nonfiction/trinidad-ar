## Next Steps:

### Future Growth - at Home and Abroad

Trinidad has grown from a small Canadian drilling contractor back in 1996 to become one of the leading high-performance drillers in North America today. We are still growing our business at home; but we are also taking our expertise and modern equipment to the global market.

#### Canadian LNG

In Canada, liquefied natural gas (LNG) development is sparking growing interest in western Canada's natural gas reserves. Asian national oil companies and large oil and gas developers are finding ways to extract, liquefy and export Canada's natural gas to the Asian market where prices are significantly higher. As regulatory hurdles are passed, demand for rigs that can drill these deep, technically challenging reserves will grow. With a reputation as a high performance driller and a customer base that already includes these companies, Trinidad is a key player in this growing market. 

#### United States

In the US, we have seen an ongoing switch away from mechanical style drilling equipment towards electrical, automated drilling rigs. These changes play right in to Trinidad's strategy. We have made our reputation with this style of modern equipment and as its benefits become more widely recognized we see opportunities to grow our fleet and expand our customer base in the US.

#### International Joint Venture

Perhaps our most exciting growth opportunity is our international expansion. Our joint venture with Halliburton Company (Halliburton) gives us an opportunity to add rigs to a broad range of countries in a timeframe we could never have managed alone. Halliburton currently operates more than 100 rigs in more than 20 countries and expects to run a significant number of these rigs through our joint venture in the coming years. So far we have added eight rigs to the joint venture in two countries - Mexico and Saudi Arabia; but this is just the first step in our future global growth.

#### Summary

Our reputation for high performance and our international joint venture open doors for us to grow and expand into more countries.

Trinidad's joint venture gives it the first right to add rigs to Halliburton's international integrated projects. Alignment with an experienced global service provider expands our opportunities and lowers our risk.

Trinidad has strong relationships with the key LNG players; we are already drilling wells and building rigs for them. As this market develops further, Trinidad is perfectly positioned to grow with it.

Lower leverage and a flexible balance sheet supports us as we grow. Our credit facilities are paid off and our long-term debt does not mature until 2019. 

We assembled a fleet of rigs that meet our customers' needs and continue to build new rigs with industry-leading technology. Our equipment is more efficient for our customers and safer for 
our crews.
