With all these opportunities around us, we have not lost sight of our goals. For the past few years, we have been very selective in the growth opportunities we have pursued and have remained committed to reducing our leverage. Our debt reduction program is largely completed now, leaving us well positioned for the next stage of our expansion. We continue to be focused on keeping a conservative balance sheet and at December 31, our credit facility was completely paid off and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.8 times. 

The safety of our people remained a top priority in 2013 and we were able to maintain our better-than-industry average safety record. For us, safety is not something we can ever sit back and stop looking for improvements. It is something we keep working at every day, being mindful not to get complacent. We watch for trends and near misses to help us identify higher risk areas and we share successes across the company, so we can all benefit from good ideas and new processes.

#### Our Next Steps

Oil and gas companies have recognized the benefits of Trinidad’s high performance equipment and are increasingly demanding this style of equipment. As the industry adapts to meet these demands, we need to stay competitive and continuously upgrade our rigs. In 2014, we will be focusing on upgrading rigs in the four to eight year old range. While these rigs perform well and are relatively modern, their efficiency and marketability can be improved by upgrading specific aspects on these rigs, often with customer support.

We will also be working on our international joint venture in 2014 and beyond. Partnering with an experienced, global oilfield services provider gives us a new avenue for growth and allows us to expand internationally more quickly than we could have alone. This arrangement also lowers the risk for us, allowing us to reduce our capital exposure and take advantage of our partner’s existing infrastructure and extensive experience.
