In the US, we have equipment across the country with our most active areas in Texas, in the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian. We saw growing competition in 2013 as more drillers started to add high-performance equipment to their fleets. However, growing customer demand for this style of equipment has increased activity levels in the last quarter of 2013 and early 2014, leading to improved dayrates and stronger industry conditions. Conditions for the five barge rigs we operate in the shallow waters adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico improved in 2013, driving strong results from these rigs.
