Not only do we have exciting international opportunities, we also have growth potential in our own back yard. As Canadian LNG development becomes more certain and the projects pass their regulatory hurdles, we expect that LNG-related activity will continue to ramp up. Trinidad has the right experience and style of equipment for this drilling and currently works for most of the key players in LNG development, positioning us well to benefit from this increased demand. 

As we move in to 2014, we have a large number of opportunities to choose from and the financial flexibility to fund our growth. Our existing business generates strong free cash flow and our conservative balance sheet provides us with a solid base to grow from. We expect industry conditions in 2014 to be similar or slightly better than 2013, with potential growth in Canada driven largely by LNG development and in the US by an ongoing move to high performance equipment. Activity levels and dayrates in the US have begun to improve in the first few months of 2014. If these conditions continue to improve, it would have positive implications for our 2014 results. In addition to these industry improvements, we are ready for the next step in our development â€“ global growth. We expect to see a growing contribution from our international joint venture as we add more rigs and expand our operations outside of North America.
