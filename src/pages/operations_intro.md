## Operations

### A quick glance

Trinidad has established operations across North America where we operate high-performance equipment in most of the key plays. Our strategy of customer-backed growth has allowed us to expand our fleet in both the US and Canada over the past few years with less risk. Our new builds are always backed by a long-term, take-or-pay contract and we keep a significant proportion of our existing fleet under these type of contracts. Now we are taking this strategy and expanding internationally, with the help of our joint venture partner, Halliburton. As well as operating high performance rigs, we also have our own in-house manufacturing facility. Here we design and build rigs that meet the needs of our customers today and operate efficiently for Trinidad for many years to come.
