## Next Steps:

### Future Growth - at Home and Abroad

Trinidad has grown from a small Canadian drilling contractor back in 1996 to become one of the leading high-performance drillers in North America today. We are still growing our business at home; but we are also taking our expertise and modern equipment to the global market.

    Canadian LNG
</h4>

In Canada, liquefied natural gas (LNG) development is sparking growing interest in western Canada's natural gas reserves. Asian national oil companies and large oil and gas developers are finding ways to extract, liquefy and export Canada's natural gas to the Asian market where prices are significantly higher. As regulatory hurdles are passed, demand for rigs that can drill these deep, technically challenging reserves will grow. With a reputation as a high performance driller and a customer base that already includes these companies, Trinidad is a key player in this growing market.

    United States
</h4>

In the US, we have seen an ongoing switch away from mechanical style drilling equipment towards electrical, automated drilling rigs. These changes play right in to Trinidad's strategy. We have made our reputation with this style of modern equipment and as its benefits become more widely recognized we see opportunities to grow our fleet and expand our customer base in the US.

    International Joint Venture
</h4>

Perhaps our most exciting growth opportunity is our international expansion. Our joint venture with Halliburton Company (Halliburton) gives us an opportunity to add rigs to a broad range of countries in a timeframe we could never have managed alone. Halliburton currently operates more than 100 rigs in more than 20 countries and expects to run a significant number of these rigs through our joint venture in the coming years. So far we have added eight rigs to the joint venture in two countries - Mexico and Saudi Arabia; but this is just the first step in our future global growth.
